PROGNOSIS DETECTION SYSTEM
ABSTRACT

Brain tumor is a life-threatening disease that requires early detection for effective treatment. In recent years, the use of deep learning algorithms has become a popular approach for brain tumor detection. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that 
combines Multi-Class CNN algorithms for brain tumor detection.Our approach uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data as input and extracts features using the MultiClass CNN network. The extracted features are then fed into the Multi-Class CNN 
algorithm for classification. The proposed approach is evaluated on a publicly available brain tumor dataset, and the results show that our approach achieves high accuracy and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.The Multi-Class CNN network is used to 
extract relevant temporal features from the MRI data, and the Multi-Class CNN algorithm is used for classification to improve the accuracy of the model. Multi-Class CNN is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to boost the performance of weak classifiers. The combination of these two algorithms results in a powerful model 
that can accurately detect brain tumors.In conclusion, our proposed approach provides a promising solution for brain tumor detection using deep learning algorithms. The combination of Multi-Class CNN algorithms offers a robust and accurate method for 
early detection of brain tumors, which can ultimately save lives.
